## Current Learning Stage

#### Basics

##### Day 1

* JDK setup. JDK = JRE + programming tools(java, javac, etc.) JRE = JVM + Java core libs
* Compilation and Execution of a Java Program
* main() as the entrance; each source file has at most one public class, each class in .java file will create a .class file after compilation
* More refer to notes in onenote
